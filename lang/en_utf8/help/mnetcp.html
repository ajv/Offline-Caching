<h1> Mnet Content Provision </h1>
<p> To configure this course to use content provided by another moodle, select the desired content provider in the first dropdown box, then from the list of courses they are offering (in the second dropdown box) select the course you want to use to provide content to your users.</p>

<p> Once you have selected a course and clicked 'reload/update', any previous mnet content provider will be sent a message to instruct them to unenrol any users on their moodle (from this moodle) who are no-longer relevant. All users enrolled in the local course are added to a queue to have their roles added/updated on the remote course. These updates take place using normal scheduled processing.</p>

<p> When users attempt to view the local course, they are automatically directed to jump to the relvant course on the mnet provider. </p>

<p> In the event that enrolments get out-of-sync, you can leave the mnet peer, and course selection drop-downs as set, and click 'reload-update' to bring the enrolments between the identity provider (this moodle), and content provider (remote moodle) back into sync.</p>
